## Step 1

Grate **lemon** zest into a large pot. Then cut the **lemon** in half and squeeze out 2 tbsp juice into a small bowl.

## Step 2

Cook **pasta** until just before al dente. (Continue with next step while you wait)

## Step 3

Add the **cream** to the pot with the lemon zest and cook over a medium heat, whisking often until the liquid is just beginning to simmer. Reduce the heat to a medium low. Whisk in the **butter** 1 tbsp at a time until melted and the sauce becomes creamy and emulsified. Remove from the heat once all the butter is added.

## Step 4

Drain the pasta, reserving pasta water for later. Add 180ml of this to the cream sauce and return to medium heat. Add the pasta to the sauce, tossing often and slowly stirring in the **parmesan**. Add pasta water if the sauce feels too thick. Stir in the lemon juice and more salt.

## Step 5

Serve!
